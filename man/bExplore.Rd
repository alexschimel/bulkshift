Explore backscatter layer statistics and relationships prior to harmonization to inform the bulk shift procedure

\details{
\code{boxplot = TRUE} draws box plots comparing the full distributions of x and y, and also the distributions where they overlap. THis
is useful for assessing the representativeness of the area overlap (i.e., whether the error model will need to extrapolate).

Local polynomial fitting using loess can be slow with large sample sizes. Subsampling using \code{loess_samp} is used here only to fit
the smoother; it is predicted on the entire dataset. Additional arguments can be passed to \code{...} (see \link{loess} for more information).
